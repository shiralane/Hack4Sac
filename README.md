This repository includes the two files that **must be included** in all project submissions for Sacramento County's [Hack4Sac Civic Tech Challenge](http://hack4sac.saccounty.net/):

1. this `README` containing instructions and information to include in your submission; and,
2. a `LICENSE` that allows anyone to do anything they want with your code as long as they provide attribution back to you and donâ€™t hold you liable.

### Project Name
UnclaimedChecks.org

### Project Description
A simple way to find and retrieve money that is owed to you by the county.  Created a video for the county to use as they wish in their distribution channels to drive attention to the unclaimed checks of Sacramento County and an easy to use responsive web application that allows users to find and claim their money with just a few steps.

### Team Members
Shira Lane, shira@unleashedproductions.net

### Stakeholder Engagement
I spoke with numerous people from various counties about the problem and did a survey to see which would be best from a user perspective. I also spoke with people from the county, who attended the Wednesday meetings about their preferences.

### Developer Documentation
Currently this is just the html, css (design) of the website and marketing materials (video and stills)

### Additional Information (optional)
The video is over 25MB and therefor I can not upload it directly to the github, but placed links above to view and download. 
I am happy to make any changes to the video and QR code, if needed, should Sacramento County wish to use it. Currently working on making it live to UnclaimedChecks.org for the presentation.
